                <p>The correspondance started in 1902 and continued for years but it is with the beginning of the war that it escalates. It became
                    some kind of war report, regular and detailed, to expose it to Murray Butler. It also was a report for all Americans, since
                    numerous letters of d’Estournelles were published in the press, mostly the New York Times.</p>
                <p>This is a long and important correspondence : the first letter, numbered as such by d’Estournelles, is dated August 15th, 1914.
                    Then, there are two last letters: the last one for the war itself and the last one for the correspondance in its entirety. The
                    last one for the war is the 579th letter, dated October 24, 1919 and it marks the end of the war with the peace treaty signature
                    and the official cease-fire. The last one of the correspondence is the 1500th letter, dated March 11th, 1924 (about two months
                    before his death).</p>
                <p>This correspondence provides a rather unique point of view on the war because Paul d’Estournelles has multiple and diverse roles in
                    this war and they are all represented at some point: father, patriot, peace representative, non-combattant (due to his age,
                    62-years-old) living in the homefront, in Paris, La Flèche or else, senator, politician or even aviation enthusiast.</p>

                <h3 id="conservation">Conservation</h3>
                <p>The correspondance is a part of the collection 12 J entitled <a href="http://archives.sarthe.fr/_depot_ad72/_depot_front/ead/serieJ/FRAD072_00000012J.pdf" title="Fonds d’Estournelles de Constant" target="_blank">“Fonds d’Estournelles de Constant”</a> and is stored in the boxes 381
                    and 382 under the name : “« La guerre 1914-1918. Collection de mes lettres numérotées au président Butler » 1914-1924”. Those two
                    boxes contain almost all the letters from the correspondence, except for part of the first volume (letters 1 to 100): the letters
                    1 to 9bis are in the collection but sometimes incomplete; the letters 10 to 100 have disappeared and only exist in New York, where
                    the other side of the correspondence, Butler’s letters, is preserved.</p>
                <p>The collection is conserved at the departmental archives of La Sarthe, in the private archives series and it contains 471 articles
                    (24,30ml), with a content going from 1776 to 1924. It is dedicated to several d’Estournelles de Constant: Claude Louis Balluet,
                    Paul’s grandfather (12J 1-20), Louise de Constant, Paul’s grandmother (12J 21-60), Léonce Balluet d’Estournelles de Constant,
                    Paul’s father (12J 61-65) and Paul d’Estournelles de Constant, whose archives are the more voluminous inside the collection (12J
                    66-471). Paul d’Estournelles de Constant’ papers has been given in 1957 by his daugther, Mrs Le Guillard.</p>

                <h3 id="PEC">Paul d'Estournelles de Constant</h3>
                <p>Paul Balluet, baron d’Estournelles de Constant de Rebecque was born on November 22nd, 1852 in La Flèche (Sarthe) and died on May
                    15th, 1924 in Paris. He first worked as a diplomat, executing missions in Tunis, London or the Hague. In 1895, he was elected at
                    the Chamber of Deputies and in 1904, he became Senator, a function he held until his death in 1924. During all his times as a
                    representative, he worked for peace and conciliation between countries with England and with Germany, successfully for the first
                    but not for the second, even though he defended it ardently, to the point of becoming suspicious for the French government. He
                    helped create the Association for International Conciliation in 1905 that then developed divisions in USA, England, Italy, Japan
                    and Germany. In 1909, d’Estournelles received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work during the Hague conference of 1899 and 1907 and
                    the creation of the Permanent Court of Arbitration.</p>
                <p>Paul d’Estournelles also instigated the extension of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in France and Europe and became
                    president of the European bureau in 1911. It is through those relations that he worked for the enlistment of the USA in the war.
                    It is also the reason for his meeting with Nicholas Murray Butler, which then turned into a friendship, as well as an intense
                    correspondence from 1914 to his death in 1924.</p>

                <h3 id="NMB">Nicholas Murray Butler</h3>
                <p>Nicholas Murray Butler was born on April 2th, 1862 in Elizabeth (New Jersey) and died in December 7th, 1947 in New York City. He
                    was a diplomat and a politician, as well as an educational administrator. He was president of Columbia University, from 1902 to
                    1945 and he helped it become a major university. He also worked in other education projects such as the foundation of the
                    Educational Review journal. As a politician, he was a member of the Republican party and tried to secure the Republican
                    presidential nomination for Elihu Root (friend of him and future Nobel Peace Prize laureate) in 1916, and in 1920 and 1928 for
                    himself. Those three attempts, however, were unsuccessful.</p>
                <p>Like d’Estournelles, he dedicated his life to peace. He was president of the American branch of the Association for International
                    Conciliation founded by d’Estournelles and was mostly engaged in the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He was
                    influential in its creation, notably by giving $10M to Andrew Carnegie, he was head of the international education and
                    communication section, he founded the European division and he held the presidency from 1925 to 1945. He too received the Nobel
                    Peace Prize, in 1931, for his action of several decades in favour of peace at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p>
